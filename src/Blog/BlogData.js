    title: "Wild West: Protecting Yourself in the Compound Semaglutide Market",
    excerpt:
      "Semaglutide for weight loss has hit the mainstream, and the rapidly growing popularity of medications like Ozempic and Wegovy has created a demand that is straining supply chains.",

      <p>Written by: Tanna Donalson, P.A.-C<br>February 25, 2025</p>
      <img src={blogImages.image1} alt="Semaglutide Market" />
      <p>Semaglutide for weight loss has hit the mainstream, and the rapidly growing popularity of medications like Ozempic and Wegovy has created a demand that is straining supply chains. According to one study conducted by the University of Southern California and the University of Wisconsin, there was a 442 percent increase in semaglutide prescription fills from January 2021 to December 2023.</p>
      <p>The increased demand and lack of supply have caused the FDA to put Ozempic and Wegovy on the health agency's drug shortage list. This means compounding pharmacies can make generic versions of the drug to help patients receive semaglutide during the shortage. This has been, for better or worse, a boon for access as compound semaglutide is significantly cheaper than Ozempic and Wegovy, which cost nearly $1,000 a month and is regularly not covered by health insurance. The semaglutide shortage has opened a massive market for less expensive compound semaglutides.</p>
      <p>Companies like Hims and Hers Health are trying to capitalize on the compound semaglutide market, investing between $14 to $16 million on a Super Bowl Commercial this year. Compounding pharmacies play a key role in helping patients and doctors access semaglutide when it is unavailable or unaffordable.</p>
      <p>However, using them is not without risk, as compounding pharmacies and companies they work with are not subject to the same FDA scrutiny as FDA-approved drugs. You must protect yourself if you buy compound semaglutide from a compounding pharmacy or buy them online. Here are a few things you should do to protect yourself from shady people selling you harmful drugs.</p>
      <h2>Only work with FDA-approved compounding pharmacies</h2>
      <img src={blogImages.image2} alt="FDA Approved" />
      <p>If you are going to take compound semaglutide, it is essential that you know what compound pharmacy it is being produced in. Your compound pharmacy must have a 503a or 503b designation by the FDA. No compound drugs are FDA-approved, but a 503A or 503B designation is confirmation that the FDA and State pharmacy boards audit the pharmacy. If they have that certification, it means they are compliant with FDA standards and are keeping to a higher standard.</p>
      <p>503A compound pharmacies are designated to create compound semaglutides for particular patients. Your medical provider sends them a script, and they make that medication on-site specifically for you.</p>
      <p>503B compound pharmacies are outsourcing facilities allowed to manufacture large batches of compound medication for healthcare facilities. These types of facilities are where large companies that sell compound semaglutide online get it from.</p>
      <p>The FDA designation means consumers can look up any 503AB compounding pharmacy to ensure it has not failed audits or committed violations. You can also track any inspections or recalls from any FDA-approved compound pharmacy in the United States at the FDA website.</p>
      <p>Do not purchase compound semaglutide from any source that can't verify the 503AB compound pharmacy it sources from. Check the FDA website to confirm that the compound pharmacy you buy from or the company you buy from is not under investigation for serious violations. Always protect yourself and do your research if you are not using the FDA-approved weight loss drugs.</p>
      <h2>Work with attentive medical providers</h2>
      <p>There are a lot of places where you can get semaglutide and compound semaglutide. There seem to be countless weight loss clinics, medical spas, and websites selling weight loss treatments. None of these providers are necessarily bad, but you must work with someone who takes your treatment and oversight of their business seriously.</p>
      <p>Anyone you work with should be able to give you a certificate of analysis showing that the compound semaglutide they use was tested for purity, safety, and efficacy. They should also be monitoring your treatment and easy to get ahold of to ensure you aren't dealing with any negative side effects. This applies if you take Ozempic, Wegovy, or the compound version.</p>
      <p>For some reason, many patients and providers treat these treatments more like vitamins than the highly potent drugs they are. Monitoring your progress and symptoms on semaglutide is essential because symptoms are not innocuous. Patients do experience side effects such as loss of bone density, extreme abdominal pain, and severe constipation. We would never treat heart disease without monitoring the patient, but for some reason, we do this with weight loss and diabetes treatment.</p>
      <p>Work with a medical professional who wants to see you often and monitor your progress. It should not be hard to get ahold of your doctor or medical provider; they should be available to hold your hand through treating your weight loss. Semaglutide can be a challenging treatment for many patients, and you should have someone who will take care of you during the process. For example, my patients can text me and get an answer to a question they have or talk about a concern. I don't expect every medical provider to give that much access, but it shouldn't take more than a day or two to get a response.</p>
      <p>Oversight is key and requires an actual professional relationship with your medical provider. Because of this, I would be very cautious about purchasing compound semaglutide online. The oversight and in-person professional relationship with your provider is just not there when buying compounding drugs online.</p>
      <p>Semaglutide is an effective weight loss treatment, which is why demand for it is so high. This demand makes the FDA-approved versions of these drugs prohibitively expensive for many. Compound semaglutide can play a key role in making this weight loss treatment more affordable, but consumers must protect themselves from shady actors looking to make a quick buck. Only use compound semaglutide on the recommendation of a trusted medical professional who sources their product from an FDA-approved 503AB compound pharmacy.</p>

      "Finding Herself Again: How GLP-1 Transformed Mandi's Life and Business",
    excerpt:
      "Mandi St. Germaine's journey with GLP-1 medications showcases resilience, empowerment, and transformation as she balanced motherhood, entrepreneurship, and personal wellness.",
    content: `
      <p>Written by: Ana Reisdorf, MS, RD<br>Reviewed by: Mandi St. Germaine<br>March 17, 2025</p>
      <img src={blogImages.image4} alt="Mandi St. Germaine" />
      <p>Mandi St. Germaine's story is one of resilience, empowerment, and transformation. A mother and stepmother to four girls, an entrepreneur, and passionate advocate for women's health, Mandi's journey into the world of GLP-1 medications began as she grappled with weight fluctuations and a family history of insulin resistance, a common struggle for many women balancing busy lives and family responsibilities.</p>
      <h2>An Early Adoption</h2>
      <p>Mandi was an early user of GLP-1 medication as a trusted family member was successfully using it with patients for weight loss before it was popular. She was initially hesitant about trying the medication, as she was not looking for just another quick fix.</p>
      <p>She did research the potential side effects and long-term impacts of the medications, but at the time there was limited information available. Her turning point came when she realized the methods she previously relied on, including rigorous workouts and careful meal planning, were no longer effective as she approached her mid-30s. After gaining nearly 50 pounds during the COVID pandemic, she decided to give this new approach to manage her weight a shot.</p>
      <h2>Slow and Steady</h2>
      <img src={blogImages.image5} alt="Slow and Steady" />
      <p>Taking a cautious approach, Mandi started at a low dose, determined to avoid drastic, rapid weight loss that could lead to regaining weight later. Her intentional strategy resulted in steady and sustainable weight loss, shedding around 40 pounds over two years.</p>
      <p>Over the last two years, she has learned the importance of maintaining a balanced lifestyle, combining medication with mindful nutrition, hydration, and regular physical activity. She recognized that GLP-1 medication wasn't merely a quick fix but a tool that was part of a larger strategy towards sustainable wellness.</p>
      <h2>A Life Shift</h2>
      <p>Mandi also candidly addressed the mental and emotional shifts she experienced along her journey. Beyond physical changes, her confidence grew significantly, positively influencing her relationships and fueling her entrepreneurial goals.</p>
      <p>As co-founder of the women-focused athleisure and lifestyle brand MBS (The Woman Beyond the Cape), she now feels comfortable and empowered in her own skin, feeling confident to take photos in workout clothes to represent the brand.</p>
      <p>After a few years on the medication, Mandi decided to switch from semaglutide to tirzepatide, which helped her find even greater alignment with her wellness goals. Tirzepatide allowed her to experience improved mental clarity, reduced hunger, and sustained energy. Her inspiring and honest story demonstrates that each individual's journey with GLP-1 medication can vary, underscoring the importance of personalized healthcare and self-awareness.</p>
      <p>Today, Mandi advocates for open conversations about GLP-1 medications, emphasizing education, realistic expectations, and holistic approaches to health. Her powerful story serves as a beacon of encouragement for others seeking to reclaim their health, confidence, and well-being, demonstrating that taking charge of your health can profoundly transform every aspect of life.</p>

    title: "Tips for Organizing Your Life on Your GLP-1 Journey",
    excerpt:
      "When you're on a weight loss journey, particularly one supported by medications like GLP-1s, shedding pounds isn't the only thing you'll be letting go of.",
    content: `
      <p>Written by: D'nai Walker<br>March 17, 2025</p>
      <img src={blogImages.image7} alt="Organizing Your Life" />
      <p>When you're on a weight loss journey, particularly one supported by medications like GLP-1s, shedding pounds isn't the only thing you'll be letting go of. You might also need to release some emotional baggage—along with those clothes in your closet that no longer fit or serve your new lifestyle. Let's get into some practical tips on how organizing your physical space can also help clear your mind, making room for your healthier, more confident self.</p>
      <h2>When to Let Go of Old Clothes</h2>
      <p>Many of us hold onto clothes that no longer fit, either hoping we'll fit into them again or fearing we might regain the weight. But it's important to ask yourself honestly:</p>
      <p>Do I actually like this clothing item?<br>
      If it were damaged, would I bother replacing or repairing it?<br>
      Is it realistically within two sizes of my current or expected size?</p>
      <p>If the answers suggest the item doesn't support your current or near-future goals, it's probably time to let go.</p>
      <h2>Emotional Attachments and How to Move On</h2>
      <p>Sentimental clothing can be challenging to discard. I recommend taking a picture or revisiting old photos of yourself wearing these items as a way of preserving the memory without keeping the physical piece.</p>
      <p>It's ok to let go of the past and who you used to be. I encourage individuals to thank their clothes for the role they've played and then move forward.</p>
      <h2>Organizing Through Your Weight Loss Journey</h2>
      <img src={blogImages.image8} alt="Organizing Your Closet" />
      <p>If you are losing weight rapidly, you may need to declutter your closet a bit more often. I typically recommend my clients organize their closets seasonally, but you may need to increase it to every six weeks.</p>
      <p>Also, consider adding size tags to your hangers. This is a simple yet effective way to keep track of clothing sizes as your body changes. This prevents frustration when getting dressed and ensures you're only reaching for items that fit well. Pair this with closet zoning, which is dedicating specific sections for different sizes in order to create a streamlined system that helps you quickly identify what's wearable now versus what might need to be stored or donated.</p>
      <p>Keep a donation bin in your closet for easy disposal of items as you transition to smaller sizes. Then be sure to take them to the donation center at least quarterly. Think of it as making space for the new you.</p>
      <h2>Practical Strategies for Supplements and Medication</h2>
      <p>On a GLP-1 you may need to take certain supplements, which can start to clutter countertops. But these are necessary reminders of your health journey.</p>
      <p>I suggest using technology, such as phone reminders, to remind you when to take your supplements, and medications, or hit other health goals. Or you might consider a 30-day pill organizer which can drastically reduce clutter, keeping your space tidy and your supplements accessible.</p>
      <h2>Emotional Benefits of Decluttering</h2>
      <p>Beyond the practical, decluttering has emotional benefits, but it can be a process. I like to emphasize mindfulness and daily affirmations to help support a positive mindset. When you feel good about your surroundings and yourself, it sets the tone for your whole day. This can be particularly important as you start to discover new parts of yourself or new ways of interacting with the world around you.</p>
      <h2>Smart Shopping Habits for Your New Wardrobe</h2>
      <p>Finally, while you might be excited to buy a whole new wardrobe, I recommend you take a pause. Instead, I want to recommend strategic shopping:</p>
      <p>Make lists of basics you need before buying.<br>
      Let potential purchases "marinate" in your cart to avoid impulse buys.<br>
      Invest in transitional pieces like wrap dresses or adjustable pants to accommodate size fluctuations.</p>
      <p>Decluttering and organizing your space is more than a physical exercise; it's a powerful act of self-care, helping you embrace your new identity and healthier lifestyle with clarity and confidence.</p>

    title: "Ozempic for Type 1 Diabetes: A Dietitian's Personal Journey",
    excerpt:
      "Lindsay Cohen, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist, shares her experience using Ozempic to manage her type 1 diabetes.",
    content: `
      <p>Written by: Ana Reisdorf, MS, RD<br>Reviewed by: Lindsay Cohen, RD, CDCES<br>March 17, 2025</p>
      <img src={blogImages.image10} alt="Type 1 Diabetes" />
      <p>Lindsay Cohen, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist, has been living with type 1 diabetes for nearly three decades. Her diagnosis inspired her to become a dietitian and help others learn to manage their diabetes better.</p>
      <h2>Discovering GLP-1 for Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
      <p>Diagnosed with Type 1 at age nine, Lindsay's personal and professional journey has centered around diabetes management. In 2023, she launched Mama Betes, a blog and online practice dedicated to supporting mothers with diabetes, highlighting the unique challenges they face.</p>
      <p>Lindsay first became intrigued by GLP-1 medications after witnessing promising results shared by others in the diabetes community online. Despite initial hesitation from her endocrinologist—who was uncomfortable prescribing Ozempic due to its off-label status—she persisted, eventually connecting with a nurse practitioner who specializes in diabetes and was willing to prescribe it virtually.</p>
      <h2>Starting Ozempic for Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
      <p>Since starting Ozempic six months ago, Lindsay has experienced significant improvements in her ability to manage her diabetes. Her hunger, previously difficult to manage due to hormone imbalances associated with type 1 diabetes, has stabilized.</p>
      <p>"Being on a GLP-1 has helped me just not feel hungry and hangry all the time," Lindsay shared on our podcast. Additionally, she has experienced significant improvements in blood sugar regulation, with fewer spikes after meals and more consistent morning blood sugar levels. Most significantly, she has been able to reduce her insulin needs by 25-30%.</p>
      <h2>Making Ozempic Work for You</h2>
      <p>However, Lindsay did discuss the importance of proper dosing. Initially, she felt nauseated after taking the recommended starting dose. But she didn't give up. She reduced the dose by half, which worked for her. This reduced the negative side effects while allowing her to still experience the beneficial effects of Ozempic on her blood sugar.</p>
      <p>Lindsay recommends that those with type 1 diabetes considering GLP-1 treatments carefully monitor their blood sugars, preferably with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and adjust insulin dosages accordingly to prevent hypoglycemia. Regular meals and adequate hydration are even more important for a Type 1 as there is an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially life-threatening condition.</p>
      <h2>Talking to Your Doctor</h2>
      <p>For those whose primary doctors or endocrinologists are hesitant to prescribe GLP-1 medications, Lindsay recommends finding qualified healthcare professionals who are open-minded and knowledgeable about diabetes management, emphasizing careful vetting to ensure you are getting the medication from a safe source.</p>
      <p>She believes strongly in working closely with your healthcare provider to find the right dose for you. "You shouldn't feel so nauseated and full that you can't eat," she stresses. If this happens, Lindsay encourages reducing the dose, rather than stopping the medication.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Lindsay hopes to see more research validating the benefits and safety of GLP-1 medications for people with type 1 diabetes. With so many new GLP-1 medications currently under development, she is optimistic about the future of GLP-1s for Type 1 Diabetes.</p>

    title: "What is ZepboundⓇ?",
    excerpt:
      "ZepboundⓇ is the brand name for tirzepatide, a GLP-1 medication approved for weight loss. Learn how it works, its side effects, and how it compares to other medications.",
    content: `
      <p>Written by: Ana Reisdorf, MS, RD<br>Reviewed by: Dr. Janelle Duah<br>April 14, 2025</p>
      <img src={blogImages.image18} alt="Zepbound" />
      <p>ZepboundⓇ is the brand name for tirzepatide, a GLP-1 medication approved for weight loss. It is the sister medication of MounjaroⓇ, which contains the same active ingredient, but is used for blood sugar management.</p>
      <p>If you are considering using ZepboundⓇ for weight loss, how does it work, and what are the side effects you can expect?</p>
      <h2>What is ZepboundⓇ?</h2>
      <p>ZepboundⓇ is a GLP-1 prescription medication made by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. It was approved by the FDA in 2023 for the treatment of obesity, similar to WegovyⓇ.</p>
      <p>The active ingredient in ZepboundⓇ is called tirzepatide, which functions slightly differently than the semaglutide found in WegovyⓇ and OzempicⓇ.</p>
      <h2>How Does ZepboundⓇ Work?</h2>
      <p>ZepboundⓇ mimics the action of the GLP-1 hormone, leading to reduced cravings and less hunger. But ZepboundⓇ takes it a step further by also targeting a hormone called glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). The targeting of both hormones seems to be more effective at helping people lose weight.</p>
      <p>According to a trial by Eli Lilly, participants on the highest dose of ZepboundⓇ lost an average of 20.9% of their body weight after 72 weeks compared with just 3% lost by the placebo group.</p>
      <h2>How Do You Take ZepboundⓇ?</h2>
      <img src={blogImages.image13} alt="Zepbound Injection" />
      <p>ZepboundⓇ must be prescribed by your healthcare provider. It comes in pre-filled pens that you store in your refrigerator. You will use the pens to inject your stomach, thigh, or upper arm once a week on the same day.</p>
      <p>The medication dose must be increased gradually. Your doctor will typically increase the dose once a month until the maximum dose is reached or you reach your goal weight. The goal of gradually increasing the medication is to reduce the risk of side effects and allow your body to get used to it.</p>
      <p>The dosage of ZepboundⓇ is as follows:</p>
      <p>2.5 mg<br>
      5 mg<br>
      7.5 mg<br>
      10 mg<br>
      12.5 mg<br>
      15 mg</p>
      <p>You may not need to reach the highest dose to see significant weight loss. Work with your provider to determine the best dose for you.</p>
      <h2>Side Effects</h2>
      <p>ZepboundⓇ does have side effects that are important to understand before you take the medication. The most common side effects are digestive issues, which may include:</p>
      <p>Nausea<br>
      Vomiting<br>
      Gas<br>
      Bloating<br>
      Diarrhea<br>
      Constipation<br>
      Stomach pain<br>
      Indigestion<br>
      Acid reflux<br>
      Fatigue<br>
      Hair loss<br>
      Dizziness<br>
      Low blood sugar</p>
      <p>There are also some severe side effects to be aware of. These may include:</p>
      <p>Severe allergic reactions<br>
      Kidney problems<br>
      Changes in vision<br>
      Suicidal thoughts or depression<br>
      Swollen lymph nodes<br>
      Thyroid tumors<br>
      Pancreatitis</p>
      <p>Talk to your doctor if you have persistent side effects that don't go away; it may take a few doses for your body to acclimate. If you experience any of the more severe side effects, seek immediate medical attention.</p>
      <h2>Is ZepboundⓇ Different Than MounjaroⓇ?</h2>
      <p>ZepboundⓇ and MounjaroⓇ contain the same active ingredient, called tirzepatide. They are sold under different names because they are approved for different medical conditions (obesity versus diabetes). Otherwise, the dosing and effect of these two medications are generally the same.</p>
      <p>The FDA requires separate approvals for drugs for different medical conditions. Additionally, different names and branding help the pharmaceutical company market the medications to different populations. It also allows insurance companies to determine which medication they will cover.</p>
      <h2>Taking ZepboundⓇ Effectively</h2>
      <p>If you are considering starting ZepboundⓇ, it is important to follow your healthcare provider's instructions carefully. Be sure to discuss any other prescriptions or dietary supplements you are taking with your provider. ZepboundⓇ is not indicated for pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p>
      <p>ZepboundⓇ is an effective weight loss medication, but it's essential to use it correctly and under medical supervision. While it can help reduce appetite and support long-term weight loss, potential side effects and dosage should be carefully managed.</p>
      <p>If you're considering a GLP-1 medication for weight loss, start by reading our comparison guide between ZepboundⓇ and WegovyⓇ to learn more. Always be sure to consult with your healthcare provider to determine if it's the right choice for you.</p>

      <p>We are still discovering so many different benefits of GLP-1 medications. While most people know they work for weight loss and blood sugar management, did you know that they have benefits for heart health as well?</p>
      <p>In this article, we will dive into the potential benefits for your heart and what the latest research says about how GLP-1 can help protect your heart.</p>
      <h2>How GLP-1 Improves Heart Health</h2>
      <img src={blogImages.image16} alt="Heart Health Research" />
      <p>Two large trials have evaluated the impact of GLP-1 on heart health. The LEADER trial evaluated how liraglutide impacted heart health in patients with type 2 diabetes who were already at a higher risk for heart attacks and strokes. The trial lasted almost 4 years and involved 9,340 participants.</p>
      <p>This study demonstrated significant benefits for heart health, showing a 13% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including nonfatal heart attacks, nonfatal strokes, and cardiovascular death.</p>
      <p>The SUSTAIN-6 trial, published in 2016, examined the safety of semaglutide on heart health in 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated risk of heart disease. Over a little over two years, semaglutide treatment resulted in a 26% reduction in MACE, especially for nonfatal strokes and heart attacks. Furthermore, semaglutide also had a positive effect on weight loss and blood pressure.</p>
      <p>A follow-up analysis published in 2019 further reinforced the original research, finding that weekly semaglutide significantly lowered the risk of cardiovascular events across all study participants, regardless of their gender, age, or initial risk status.</p>
      <p>There are even more potential benefits for heart health and GLP-1. Here's a quick summary of some additional research:</p>
      <h3>Lower Risk of Heart Attacks and Strokes</h3>
      <p>Clinical trials have found that GLP-1s reduce major cardiovascular events, like heart attacks and strokes, by up to 17%. This risk reduction is particularly significant in those with type 2 diabetes or pre-existing heart conditions. GLP-1s protect the heart by reducing inflammation, improving blood flow, and supporting overall heart health.</p>
      <h3>Weight Loss and Blood Pressure Reduction</h3>
      <p>By promoting weight loss and lowering blood pressure, GLP-1s indirectly improve your heart health. Losing weight and controlling blood pressure can significantly decrease your risk of heart disease.</p>
      <h3>Improving Cholesterol Levels</h3>
      <p>GLP-1s can help improve your cholesterol, particularly by lowering LDL ("bad" cholesterol). Better cholesterol means healthier arteries and a lower chance of developing serious heart conditions.</p>
      <h3>Healthier Blood Vessels</h3>
      <p>Your blood vessels love GLP-1s because these medications improve endothelial function, or the function of the lining of your arteries, by helping them relax, promoting better circulation, and reducing inflammation.</p>
      <h3>Heart Failure Benefits</h3>
      <p>Heart failure can impair the ability of the heart to relax enough to receive blood, called diastolic dysfunction. Most treatments for heart failure focus on treating reduced ejection fraction, which is related to the heart's ability to pump blood. There are limited definitive treatments for heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this new research has been pivotal. It has been shown that GLP-1s can help improve this type of heart failure, when no treatments existed before. The effect of this is likely due to the anti-inflammatory effects of this medication.</p>
      <h2>The FDA Gets on Board</h2>
      <p>On March 8, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new indication for Wegovy (semaglutide) injection to lower the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke in adults with heart disease who are either obese or overweight.</p>
      <p>This approval was based on a clinical trial with over 17,600 participants. Wegovy significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, which occurred in 6.5% of participants who received Wegovy compared to 8% of participants who received a placebo. This is the first weight loss medication approved to help prevent life-threatening cardiovascular events.</p>
      <p>Recently, Zepbound was also approved for the treatment of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea puts significant strain on the heart by repeatedly interrupting breathing during sleep, which causes oxygen levels to drop and triggers surges in blood pressure.</p>
      <p>Over time, this can lead to chronic hypertension, increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, and even enlargement of the heart. It also disrupts the heart's electrical system, raising the risk of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. It can worsen existing conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery disease.</p>
      <p>Left untreated, sleep apnea can seriously compromise heart health, but with proper diagnosis and treatment, like using a CPAP machine and now using Zepbound, it's possible to reduce these risks and improve cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
      <p>Right now, we know that GLP-1s can benefit blood sugar control, weight management, and heart health. If you are interested in learning more about these benefits for your health, it is always best to speak to your healthcare provider.</p>

      <img src={blogImages.image18} alt="High-Protein Lunches" />
      <p>If you're on a GLP-1 medication, you know the medication reduces your hunger cues. While this is the benefit of the medication and the reason it induces weight loss, this makes it difficult to get the nutrition you need every day, especially protein.</p>
      <p>Without enough protein, you may be losing lean muscle mass instead of just fat, which will impact your metabolic health in the long run. Muscle loss can also predispose you to mobility issues and fractures later in life.</p>
      <p>Consuming enough protein is important for preserving the muscle mass you already have, especially when you're eating fewer calories. Protein can also keep you feeling full longer and help keep your blood sugar in check, which also supports weight loss.</p>
      <p>It is important to prioritize protein at each meal to avoid adverse effects from the GLP-1 medications and continue to support your weight loss journey.</p>
      <p>To make it easier for you to eat enough protein, we gathered easy high-protein lunch recipes from fellow registered dietitians to help you effortlessly reach your goals. Lunch needs to be quick and simple since you are likely busy with other tasks. Each of these recipes has at least 20 grams of protein to keep you full all afternoon.</p>
      <h2>Dietitian-Approved High-Protein Lunch Salads</h2>

      "GLP-1 Medications and Muscle Loss: Why Strength Training Is Non-Negotiable",
    excerpt:
      "As GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound continue to dominate the conversation in the fitness and nutrition space, an important question is emerging: Do GLP-1s cause muscle loss? And more importantly, what can you do to prevent losing muscle while still losing weight?",
    content: `
      <p>Written by: Ana Reisdorf, MS, RD<br>Reviewed by: Aaron Hines, MS, ACSM-CPT<br>April 29, 2025</p>
      <img src={blogImages.image5} alt="GLP-1 Medications and Muscle Loss" />
      <p>As GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound continue to dominate the conversation in the fitness and nutrition space, an important question is emerging: Do GLP-1s cause muscle loss? And more importantly, what can you do to prevent losing muscle while still losing weight?</p>
      <p>I sat down with personal trainer Aaron Hines of Premiere Performance Training in Brentwood, TN, to tackle this vital topic. Aaron specializes in working with adults over 45, including many who are starting or currently taking GLP-1 medications. His mission is simple: help clients live pain-free, stay mobile, and maintain their strength well into their later years.</p>
      <h2>GLP-1 and Muscle Loss: What's Really Happening?</h2>
      <p>According to Aaron, muscle loss is a real concern, especially for the older adults he works with. "When someone is losing weight quickly and isn't doing any strength training, they're not just losing fat," he said. "They're losing muscle mass, too."</p>
      <p>And while some people are thrilled to lose their appetite and drop weight fast, Aaron warns that muscle is essential for long-term health. "You need muscle mass to climb stairs, get off the floor, or even prevent falls. If you're not strength training, you're putting yourself at risk."</p>
      <p>A long, healthy, and pain-free life requires adequate muscle to support day-to-day movements. Once you lose that, you are at risk of fractures and loss of mobility.</p>
      <h2>GLP-1 and Weight Lifting: Why You Need Both</h2>
      <p>Aaron emphasizes that GLP-1 medications should be treated as a tool, not a magic solution. "The trifecta is the medication, proper nutrition—especially protein intake—and consistent strength training," he explained.</p>
      <p>Even with clients who feel dizzy or fatigued from the medication, Aaron doesn't give up. Instead, he adjusts the intensity of their workouts, gives them more rest between sets, and encourages small meals or protein shakes before training. "We meet them where they're at," he said, "but the strength training still has to happen."</p>
      <h2>Can You Build or Maintain Muscle on a GLP-1?</h2>
      <img src={blogImages.image6} alt="Strength Training with GLP-1" />
      <p>The answer is yes—if you're consistent. "We've had clients who spaced out their dosage or even came off the medication and maintained their weight loss through intense strength training and nutrition," said Aaron. "It's possible, but it takes commitment."</p>
      <p>He shared stories of clients, especially women, who have lost weight on GLP-1s and maintained it by lifting heavier weights and building muscle. One client even phased out her medication completely after realizing how good she felt with consistent workouts.</p>
      <h2>How Often Should You Train on GLP-1?</h2>
      <p>Aaron recommends at least two days a week of strength training focused on full-body movements. "That includes upper and lower body, core, and mobility work. Balance exercises are especially critical as you age," he said.</p>
      <p>For cardio, he suggests 30–60 minutes on non-training days, at a pace that gets your heart rate up. And don't forget stretching and mobility—key for preventing injury and staying independent.</p>
      <h2>What If You Can't Afford a Trainer?</h2>
      <p>Aaron's advice: start with bodyweight exercises and resistance bands at home. "You don't need to spend a fortune. $200 or less will get you everything you need to begin." He even offers virtual training programs that include personalized workouts and form checks via Zoom.</p>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>There's no denying the effectiveness of GLP-1 medications for weight loss. But without strength training and proper nutrition, you may be sacrificing your muscle mass—and with it, your long-term health.</p>
      <p>If you're concerned about GLP-1 causing muscle loss, this will depend on what you do next. Pairing your medication with a structured strength training program is essential.</p>
      <p>Aaron put it best: "If you're on this medication and you're not lifting weights, you're doing yourself a disservice."</p>

    excerpt:
      "Digestive health is fundamental to overall well-being, impacting everything from energy levels to immunity and mood. For individuals taking GLP-1 medications, digestive side effects like nausea, constipation, bloating, and diarrhea are a common concern.",
    content: `
      <p>Written by: Ana Reisdorf, MS, RD<br>May 14, 2025</p>
      <img src={blogImages.image8} alt="Soothing Digestive Side Effects" />
      <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This blog post is sponsored by Relesium. All opinions expressed are based on careful review and are solely my own.</p>
      <p>Digestive health is fundamental to overall well-being, impacting everything from energy levels to immunity and mood. For individuals taking GLP-1 medications, digestive side effects like nausea, constipation, bloating, and diarrhea are a common concern. Fortunately, a clinically-tested and patented combination of ingredients has emerged as effective for easing common side effects.</p>
      <h2>Why Do GLP-1 Medications Cause Digestive Side Effects?</h2>
      <p>GLP-1 medications, like semaglutides or tirzepatides, slow gastric emptying, meaning food moves through your digestive system more slowly. This effectively reduces appetite and promotes weight loss. However, this slower digestion can increase the risk of gastrointestinal discomfort, including bloating, nausea, and general digestive upset, negatively affecting overall well-being.</p>
      <p>Persistent digestive disruption not only diminishes quality of life but can also lead to long-term complications, emphasizing the importance of addressing these side effects proactively. Fortunately, I was recently introduced to Relesium. This specialized formula helps ease common digestive side effects, restoring comfort and digestive health for those using GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Mounjaro, Zepbound, or Wegovy.</p>
      <p>This all-natural, clinically reviewed supplement soothes GI discomfort caused by GLP-1 medications. With a patented combination of antibody-rich chicken egg powder and bovine colostrum, Relesium helps restore gut integrity, balance the microbiome, and promote overall digestive wellness, without interfering with your medication's effectiveness.</p>
      <h2>Why Relesium Works for GLP-1 Users</h2>
      <p>GLP-1 medications work by slowing gastric emptying, which helps you feel fuller longer and supports weight loss. But this delayed digestion can also cause food to sit longer in the gut, creating the perfect conditions for GI distress.</p>
      <p>Relesium addresses the root causes of this discomfort by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neutralizing unfavorable bacteria in the gut</li>
        <li>Proactively strengthening and stabilizing healthy gut biomes, linings, and tissues.</li>
        <li>Enhancing nutrient absorption for optimal health</li>
        <li>Supporting a balanced gut microbiome with prebiotic-rich ingredients</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Relesium also provides essential micronutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. All of these components are particularly important for GLP-1 users with digestive side effects. Additionally, the prebiotic content supports a healthy microbiome, while immunoglobulins and antimicrobial peptides help deter harmful bacteria from worsening symptoms.</p>
      <p>Whether you're just starting your GLP-1 journey or looking for relief from persistent side effects, Relesium provides a proactive solution for digestive support.</p>
      <h2>Backed by Nature, Supported by Science</h2>
      <p>Relesium's targeted effectiveness comes from its two core ingredients, which work synergistically to calm digestive distress:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bovine colostrum:</strong> Known as "nature's first food," colostrum contains immunoglobulin G (IgG) and lactoferrin—both shown to support immune health, reduce inflammation, and reinforce gut lining integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken egg powder:</strong> Provides lysozyme, a natural enzyme that combats bad bacteria, and glutamine, an amino acid that nourishes and repairs the intestinal lining.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, these ingredients support the gut in a powerful yet gentle way, ideal for those navigating the digestive challenges of GLP-1 therapy.</p>
      <p>In fact, in an observational study of 30 individuals taking GLP-1 medications, 20 participants experiencing digestive issues added Relesium to their routine. Nearly 100% (19 or 95%) reported meaningful improvement in symptoms, including reduced bloating, less nausea, and more regular digestion. A placebo-controlled clinical trial is underway to validate these results further.</p>
      <p>Read this <a href="#">Nutrients article</a> for those who want to learn more about the science behind these ingredients.</p>
      <p>Managing the GI side effects of GLP-1 medications is vital for overall treatment success. Relesium offers a promising, natural solution by addressing the root causes of GI discomfort without compromising the effectiveness of GLP-1 medications.</p>
      <p>Relesium is a lightly flavored vanilla powder that is easy to add to smoothies, yogurt, or just drink with a few ounces of cool water. Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate supplementation and dosage tailored to your individual needs. By proactively supporting your gut health, you can significantly enhance your overall well-being and success on GLP-1.</p>
