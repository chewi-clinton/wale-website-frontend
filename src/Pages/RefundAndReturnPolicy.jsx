          be met:
        </p>
        <ul className="refund-list">

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note: Due to the nature of prescription medications, we cannot accept
          returns or offer refunds for opened or used products unless the

          and state regulations.

      <section className="refund-section">
        <h2>Refund Process</h2>
        <p>
          Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email
          to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also
          notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are
          approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will
          automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of
          payment within 7-10 business days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shipping costs are non-refundable unless the return is due to an error
          on our part (e.g., wrong or damaged item shipped). If you receive a
          refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.

        <h2>Late or Missing Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account
          again. Then contact your credit card company, as it may take some time
          before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank, as
          there is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If
          you’ve done all of this and still have not received your refund,
          please contact us at Email: dr@trimaxapharmacy.com.

        <h2>Exchanges</h2>
        <p>
          We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to
          exchange it for the same item, send us an email at
          dr@trimaxapharmacy.com.

        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>
          If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly
          to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return.
          Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed
          to you. If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the
          gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later,
          we will send a refund to the gift giver, and they will find out about
          your return.

        <h2>Shipping Returns</h2>
        <p>
          To return your product, you should mail your product to the address
          provided by our team. You will be responsible for paying for your own
          shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are
          non-refundable. Depending on where you live, the time it may take for
          your exchanged product to reach you may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are returning more expensive items, you may consider using a
          trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don’t
          guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
